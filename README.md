**OOD Detection for Food Classification** 

This project focuses on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in the context of multi-class image classification using deep learning. The goal is to develop a model that can:
  -Accurately classify known (in-distribution) food images (from the Food-101 dataset);
  -Detect and reject unknown (out-of-distribution) samples (e.g., SVHN, Food Packaging).

**Motivation** \n
Standard classifiers may confidently misclassify unfamiliar inputs. To address this, we explore energy-based OOD detection strategies to improve the model's robustness.
